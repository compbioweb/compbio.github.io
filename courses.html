					<h3>CSC 2417H Algorithms for Genome Analysis </h3>
					<p>This graduate course will cover some exciting algorithms that have been developed to analyze genomic and functional data, including Genome comparison and assembly, gene prediction, localization of regulatory elements in the genome, and analysis and comparison of biological networks. While the emphasis of the class will be on discrete algorithms, we occasionally will talk about probabilistic models (such as HMMs), and the interplay between discrete and probabilistic models. The course is intended for computer science graduate students, and all of the required biology will be explained in the class. Students in biological and related sciences with a strong computational background are encouraged to participate.</p>

					<h3>CSC 2418H Computational Structural Biology </h3>
					<p>In the post-genomic era, several key problems in molecular biology center on the determination and exploitation of three-dimensional protein structure and function. This graduate course will cover the computational aspects of Structural Biology - the modeling and computer simulation of structure, function, and dynamics of biological molecules. We will study algorithms to facilitate protein structure determination by X-Ray Crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy, Protein-Protein Interactions, Computer-Assisted Pharmaceutical Design, and Structure/Function Analysis. In addition to covering historic and contemporary algorithms, we will discuss open problems plaguing the field. The course is intended for computer science graduate students, and all the required biology will be explained in the class. Students in biological and related sciences with a strong computational background are strongly encouraged to participate.</p>

					<h3>CSC2431H Topics in Computational Molecular Biology  </h3>
					<p>The topics discussed in this course vary from year to year and generally depend on the instructor.</p>
